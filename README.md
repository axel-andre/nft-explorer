# NFT Explorer

A small project to showcase my front-end and back-end skills. It is also a neat way to try Gitpod out :)

A quick way to launch the project is with gitpod with the following button :

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn run dev
```

## My choices

### Monorepo & Gitpod
I choose to develop the project with Gitpod to be productive right away. No need to setup the database. Plus it will be easier for you to review the code and run the project, without needing anything to be installed on you machine. For a team, separated repositories can make the readability of the history easier.

### Nestjs
Nestjs is a backend technologie that can make you up & running quickly when using the CLI. I has a good Typescript support and if needed it is possible to add a Swagger documentation quickly with it's built-in module.
### Svelte
Svelte is a fairly new framework but I think that it is an excellent solution for small projects, which is something I liked a lot. If the application scale, a technology like React can be a good solution as it has a more active community and have a great ecosystem.
### Postgresql
For a small size project, a document based database (like mongodb) could also have been a great solution.

## Things to add / improve
* Add a metamask connection and authentication
* Make the app responsive
* Make a 404 page
* Make a more general error page in the front
